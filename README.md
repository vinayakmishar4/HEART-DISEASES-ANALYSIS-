## Overview
Heart disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide. This project aims to analyze patterns in patient data to uncover potential risk factors. Using **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**, we dive into the data with visualizations and statistical summaries.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

## Dataset
The dataset used is `heart.csv`. It contains several health parameters such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Level
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise-Induced Angina, etc.

## Results

The analysis provides insights such as:
-Correlation between cholesterol levels and heart disease.
-Impact of exercise-induced angina on heart health.
-Distribution of age groups and their association with heart disease.
