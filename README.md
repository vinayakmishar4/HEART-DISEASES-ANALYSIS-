Heart Disease Analysis using EDA

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from a heart disease dataset. Through visualizations and statistical summaries, the aim is to identify patterns and key factors contributing to heart disease.

Features

	•	Analysis of important health metrics such as:
	•	Age, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, and Maximum Heart Rate (MaxHR)
	•	Visualizations to explore the distribution of key features
	•	Categorical analysis of features like gender and chest pain type
	•	Insights into correlations between variables affecting heart disease

Technologies Used

	•	Python
	•	Pandas – for data manipulation
	•	Matplotlib and Seaborn – for data visualization
	•	NumPy – for numerical operations

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named heart.csv. It contains various patient health metrics to determine the presence of heart disease.

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-eda.git
cd heart-disease-eda


	2.	Install the required dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy


	3.	Make sure the heart.csv file is in the project directory.

Usage

	1.	Open the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook HEART_DISEASE_ANALYSIS_USING_EDA.ipynb


	2.	Run the cells step by step to perform EDA on the dataset.
	3.	Example visualizations include:
	•	Distribution plots for age, cholesterol, and resting blood pressure.
	•	Pie charts showing distribution by gender.

Results

The analysis explores patterns that could indicate the likelihood of heart disease. Some key findings include:

	•	Distribution patterns of health metrics.
	•	Gender differences in heart disease occurrence.
	•	Relationships between cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and heart conditions.

Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

	1.	Fork the project.
	2.	Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
	3.	Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add a new feature').
	4.	Push the changes (git push origin feature-branch).
